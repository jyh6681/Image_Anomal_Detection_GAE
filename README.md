# Image_Anomal_Detection_GAE
This is a repository for image anomaly detection with Graph Auto Encoder

## Below is a brief instruction of implementing this project on your own image data

### Specify the directory of the training data in Anomal_Image_Dataset when using supervised training strategy

### Specify the directory of the training data in Normal_Image_Dataset when using self-supervised training strategy


### Training the GAE model:

```
python3 gae_run_image_dataset.py
```


### Make prediction:
```
python3 gae_run_image_dataset_test.py
```
